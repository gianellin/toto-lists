## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties.
- JavaScript.

### What I learned

This project let me do a review of how to manipulate the DOM and create functionaity with JavaScript. At the same time, I could create a minimal User Interface with practical use.

### Continued development

- The aplication lack storage capabilities. It can be added to work locally with a function store the data.
- It could also have a priority setting, and different list based on priorities.
